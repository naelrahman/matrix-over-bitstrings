# set-key-exchange
Tagline: Implementation for a key exchange using matrices with entries as sets of numbers

This is a project I am working on with Prof. Vladimir Shpilrain of City College.
A link to his research can be found here: http://shpilrain.ccny.cuny.edu/res.html



About the implementation:

The implementation uses a Python library called bistrings to represent the elements of the set.

For an index number x, if the entry is 0, x+1 is not in the set. If the entry is 1, x+1 is in the set.
